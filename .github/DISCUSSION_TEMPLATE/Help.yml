        Collect logs by using something similar to `docker logs timemachine >& output.log` if needed and attach them or copy out the relevant portions of the error. When in doubt, do both. I can't help without logs!

      description: |
        If you can run the container but backups fail, collect logs from the client by using something similar to `printf '\e[3J' && log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.TimeMachine"' --info --last 6h | grep -F 'eMac' | grep -Fv 'etat' | awk -F']' '{print substr($0,1,19), $NF}'`, adjusting the time from `6h` to something resonable to catch the error at least once and attach them.  I can't help without logs!

        If you can run the container but backups fail, another tool that can help with diagnosing the issue is [Time Machine Mechanic](https://eclecticlight.co/consolation-t2m2-and-log-utilities/) which can collect logs and attempt to pinpoint the root cause of the backups failing.
